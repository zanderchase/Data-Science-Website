        <h3> Writeup: </h3>
        <p>
          This is a visualization of Marleys trains. The x-axis contains the hour of the day and the y-axis contains the various train stops. Each line represents the path of one train throughout the course of the day.
          The first thing I did in setting up this visualization was to set up my axis. I set the x-axis with the appropriate range of time values and left the y-axis blank initialy.
          When I oppened up the distance data I was able to get the train stops and their corresponding distance from Paris. Using these distance values and location names I was able to created a weighted y-axis that was spaced acording to distance by passing in the values I obtained.
          Once I had the two axis set up I openned the schedule data. With the schedule data I was able to create a dictionary that held the y-value of a stop and the corresponding x-value of the time the stop occured at. I took into account both the arrival and departure times of the train to create and accurate schedule.
          One I had all the stop data I used d3.line() to create the train lines. I ran into some initial problems with this in getting the lines to appear properly, but once I figured out how the function to draw lines worked I was able to pass in the appropriate values.
          With the train lines drawn I focused on mouse movement. If I hovered over a train line that line would be highlighted in red. I also created a vertical line that moves with the mouse to show train times.
