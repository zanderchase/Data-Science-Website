      <h3>Introduction: What Does The Fox Say?: An analysis of one-hit wonders:</h3>
        <p>
          In this project, we aim to investigate the various factors that lead to the creation, and popularity, of a one-hit wonder. A one-hit wonder is defined by Billboard (which is the music industry standard for measuring chart performance) as “an act that has won a position on [the] national, pop, Top 40 just once.”
        </p>
        <p>
          So far, the majority of our efforts has been focussed on data collection and processing. In order to tackle the problem of identifying the various characteristics of music charts when a one-hit-wonder comes out, we decided to use two datasets: Billboard Hot 100 and LastFM data.
        </p>
      <h3>Billboard Hot 100 Data:</h3>
        <p>
          We were able to successfully clean and process this dataset, which reaches all the way back to 1998. Each row of this data set contains information for: date of position, position in the Hot 100, song name, artist name, position in the preceding week, peak position in the Hot 100, number of weeks on the chart.
        </p>
        <p>
          We ran into a couple of issues that we had to address during the cleaning of the data. For example, we ran into a problem where an artist name for a particular song would appear in the form “Artist1 featuring Artist1”. Annoyingly, the way that “featuring” was represented was not always consistent throughout the Billboard data—sometimes an artist name could be “Artist1 x Artist2” or “Artist1 ft. Artist2”. Thus, we applied various cleaning methods to ensure that we could successfully isolate “Artist1” in these instances.
        </p>
        <p>
          Additionally, we checked each artist name to their respective artist profile URL on billboard.com. For example, if the artist was “Calvin Harris”, our program checks that an artist profile exists for that artist on the website. If an anchor tag leading to an artist’s page was present in the Billboard Hot 100 page for that particular week, we considered that artist a valid artist.
        </p>
      <h3>LastFM Data:</h3>
        <p>
          Because the Billboard data does not specify the genre of the music, we use data from last.fm to find the genre for each song. We were successfully able to scrape and clean data from the last.fm API.
        </p>
      <h3>Moving forward:</h3>
        <p>
          Our immediate goals in the next few weeks are to successfully merge the lastFM and Billboard data. Additionally, we aim to begin to find some high level statistics for the dataset, such as: finding the number of one-hit wonders per year, and finding the the most prominent genres per year. Additionally, we would like to create some way to visualize the one hit wonders and chart data. Finally, we will implement machine learning algorithms to predict how popular a one-hit wonder may be given the specific chart year.
