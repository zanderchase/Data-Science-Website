      <h3>Machine Learning Analysis: </h3>
        <p> Last week we updated our dataset to include genres of all of the top songs. 
          Once our dataset  was complete with information regarding song duration on the top charts, 
          peak performance, genre, ext. we were ready to perform analysis on our data set. 
        </p>
        After assessing various potential options we decided to implement a naive bayes ML analysis 
        on the dataset. For each song we added a tag that specified if it was a one-hit wonder with true 
        representing a one-hit wonder and false representing a song that was not. This would be used as a 
        label in our training set to learn what attributes were responsible for a one hit wonder. For features 
        we extracted various descriptive qualities such as peak performance, time on the top charts, and genre. 
        After storing two arrays with our training attributes and training labels, we initialized our classifier. 
        Using the classifier we fit it with our data and were able to get the mean and std deviation scores. 
        <p>
          Once we trained our data using song data from various years we moved onto testing it. 
          First, we obtained new label and attribute data from our testing data. Using this 
          new data and our classifier we used the predict function to try and estimate future labels.
           Using the actual labels from the test data and the predicted test labels we created a confusion matrix. ……..

      <h3>Moving forward:</h3>
        <p>
          The above graph is one example of the type of analysis that we wish to compile for the rest 
          of the project, and thus represents a midpoint between our midterm report and where we want 
          to be when the project is completed. In this graph we show the most popular genres for a given year 
          (in this case 2015). It is our goal to expand this work and have a complete data set for the most 
          popular genres for each year. 
        </p>
        <p>
          One of the goals of our midterm report was to work out any last kinks in our data. As of now our data 
          is finally complete, cleaned, and ready to be used for extensive analysis. Additionally, we experimented 
          with visualizing the chart movement for various other one hit wonders as we demonstrated in the midterm 
          report. Finally, we have continued to analyze the effect of various features on our different analyses.
        </p>
        <p>
          Moving forward we hope to use further machine learning and visualizations to analyze our data. Looking at the trends of one-hit wonder songs gave us an interesting insight into what constitutes a one-hit wonder. The next thing we hope to look into is the impact of genres the of other popular songs during the rise of a one-hit wonder. By gathering data of songs during a certain time period we can see how popular each genre was during that time period. Comparing this data to the genre of a one-hit wonder during that time period will give us an interesting insight into the impact that genre has on the rise of a one-hit wonder. Another approach to analyzing our data that we want to take is through visualization. Using D3 we hope to create a visualization that shows the path of all one-hit wonders on the billboard top 100 chart. By selecting a certain one-hit wonder from the list it will display the trajectory of its path overtime. This will be an interesting way to easily visualize how specific one-hit wonder songs rise and fall over time. We may also include the one-hit wonder genre and most popular genres of the time period to visualize the impact that genres have on one-hit wonder trajectories. This is a long term goal of ours to enable users to easily visualize the path of all the one-hit wonders from the past 15 years.
