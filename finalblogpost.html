      <h1>Final Blog Post: 5/10/17</h1>
      <h3>Update: </h3>
        <p> Today was a momentous day in the evolution of our final project. We presented our final poster and turned in 
          our final report, both of which went well. Below we are going to give a brief overview of our project and
          what we were able to achieve.
        </p>
 
      <h3>Overview:</h3>
        <p>
         In this project, we aimed to investigate the various factors that lead to the creation and popularity of a one-hit wonder. A one-hit wonder is defined by Billboard (which is the music industry standard for measuring chart performance) as “an act that has won a position on [the] national, pop, Top 40 just once.” Similarly, a wonder is any song that enters the Top 40. By looking at Billboard Top 100 data of songs from 2000 - 2015 we compared one-hit wonders to other wonders of the same time period. By analyzing different features such as genre and lasting time on the top charts we hoped to find the characteristics that distinguished a one-hit wonder.

      <h3>Conclusion:</h3>
        <p>
         In this project we applied that knowledge that we accumulated throughout the semester. First, we websraped the necessary data and created a database in order to easily access it. Next, we performed several statistical analyses on the data gaining various insights into the different characteristics of a one-hit wonder. To represent our findings we created a variety of different graphs, charts, and visualizations. Furthermore, we utilized various different techniques to maximize the predictive power of our machine learning. From doing this project we put to use the tools we learned in class and completed a project that integrated all aspects of data science.

      <p>
From our extensive analysis into one-hit wonders we were able to gain various insights that allowed us to answer our hypothesis. By looking at the movement of one-hit wonder songs up and down the charts across all genres we saw no significant difference between their movement and that of other top wonders. The d3 visualization showing one-hit wonders allowed us to see the movement all individual one-hit wonders per year. The graphs showing the lasting time and peak position of one-hit wonders compared to other wonders showed the similarities between song features. Lastly, by graphing the total trajectory of one-hit wonders and all wonders we were able to conclude that their chart movement during their life on the top charts was very similar.

Another important insight gained from our analysis is the importance of genre as a defining characteristic of one-hit wonders. From our machine learning section, we determined that genre made a significant difference in helping predict whether a song would be a one-hit wonder or not. Additionally, we were able to glean various interesting observations about genre trends for one-hit wonders over the timeframe that we analyzed. As mentioned above, rock virtually died out as a popular genre for one-hit wonders. Pop, as we intuitively predicted, was consistently the most popular genre for one-hit wonders. Whatmore, we were able to observe an interesting trend with the genre ‘country’: there was a lack of one-hit wonders in this genre, even though ‘country’ as a genre performed well for regular wonders. Interestingly, we were also able to observe that most one-hit wonders come out during the months of May and June, even though these months were not the most popular for the entrance of regular wonders into the chart. This observation gives more credence to our investigation into the phenomenon of the “song of the summer”.

In this project we performed various different analyses of one-hit wonder and other top song data to gain insights into our initial hypotheses. Song chart movement interestingly turned out to not differentiate much between one-hit wonders and other wonders. Genre, on the other hand, had many attributes that were unique to one-hit wonders. After a semester of hard work we were finally able to answer the question that one-hit wonder artist Ylvis posed to the music world: What does the Fox Say?
